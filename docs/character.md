## Examples

### AdjustAim

AdjustAim works in much the same way as timelines. It accepts any number of arguments, where the first argument is speed, the second argument is either a relative rotation, or a vector to look at, and the third parameter is easing. 

Possible easing values are "Linear" (default), "EaseIn", and "EaseInOut".

```lua
function ExampleScript:LookAtStuff(player)
    player:AdjustAim(
        10, Vector.New(100, 100, 100) -- look at point (100, 100, 100) with speed 10,
        100, Rotation.New(360, 0, 0), "EaseOut", -- Rotate 360 degrees with a speed of 100, easing out of the last position
        1000, Vector.New(0,0,0), "EaseIn", -- Look at point (0, 0, 0) with a speed of 1000, easing in as the adjustment finished
    )
end
```

### PlayAction

The second argument for PlayAction is a table of properties.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| playbackSpeed | number | Sets the speed to play this animation at. 2 = double speed, 0.5 = half speed |
| playbackTime | number | Sets the time that this animation should take in seconds |
| events | table | Some actions trigger events – these are functions that will be triggered in your Lua code once the animation for an action reaches a certain point |

#### Grips

##### Cuff
###### Actions

| Action | Event | Branching | Description |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | 
| Fire | None  | None | This will perform a 'interacting' animation with the cuff screen |
| Fire | IsCompleted | Yes | If false, the player will start another cycle of interacting with the screen. If true, then the animation will end. |
| Fire | OnCompleted | No | Triggers at the end of the animation (after `IsCompleted` returns true if the event is defined). |

###### Example

```lua
local animData = {}
animData.playbackSpeed = 1.0
animData.events =
    {
        IsCompleted = function ()
           Print("Checking if player is still looking at a menu")
           return not self.inMenu
        end,
        OnCompleted = function ()
            Print("Finished interacting with menu")
        end
    }
self:GetEntity():PlayAction("Fire", animData)
```

###### Example

```lua
local animData = {}
animData.playbackSpeed = 2.0
animData.events =
    {
        IsReloadComplete = function ()
           Print("Checking if full")
           return self.bullets == self.properties.maxBullets
        end,
        AmmoAdded = function ()
            self.bullets = self.bullets + 1
            Print("Added Bullets, current ammo = " .. self.bullets )
        end
    }
self:GetEntity():PlayAction("Reload", animData)
```
